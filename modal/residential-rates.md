### City Surcharge

On August 1st, 2006 the Paso Robles City Council passed resolution No. 06-142, a resolution of the City of Paso Robles approving changes to solid waste collection rates for Paso Robles Waste Disposal. The first component of the resolution addresses the solid waste collection surcharge. A portion of the cost incurred by the City of Paso Robles purchasing 53 acres adjacent to the municipal landfill is to be paid by a solid waste collection surcharge on all Paso Robles Waste Disposal customers. The implementation of the surcharge will take place on September 1, 2006.

Initially, residential customers will pay an additional $1.10 per month or $13.20 per year and commercial customers will pay an additional $2.34 or $28.08 annually.
