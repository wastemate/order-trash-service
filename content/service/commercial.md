## Bin Sizes
You can choose from the following container sizes: 1.5-yard, 2-yard, 3-yard, and 4-yard.

## Frequency of Service
You may choose to have your containers emptied from once to six times per week. Saturday service is only available on 3 and 4-yard containers.

## Recycling
We have three main recycling programs all of which are available to our customers at no additional charge.

### WHY RECYCLE AT YOUR BUSINESS?
Recycling is an environmentally sound choice and it will save your business money. By effectively recycling you will be able to reduce the volume of materials that are placed in your garbage dumpster. Since our pricing structure is based on the size/frequency of only your garbage service there is an excellent economic advantage to recycling any and all materials that are recyclable.

### WHAT COMMERCIAL RECYCLING PROGRAMS DO WE OFFER?
<p style="margin-left:40px" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436553156497_306"><strong id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436553156497_305">1. Commingle "single stream" recycling</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Using this program you are able to mix all of your non-organic recyclables in a single container. This is the most efficient way for us to collect recyclables from your business because a single truck will come to service this container that may have dozens of different recyclable materials in it. All materials are transferred to a recycling processor where they are sorted for recycling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">We've found that most businesses greatly benefit from this service. Your employees don't need to waste time sorting materials. Also, this is the same type of recycling service that most people have at their homes and all of the same materials are accepted so educating your employees to fully participate in the recycling program at your business takes less effort.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Container sizes available:</strong></p>

* 96-gallon automated cart
* 1.5-yard split-bin
* 2-yard split-bin
* 3-yard bin
* 4-yard bin

<p style="margin-left:40px"><em><strong>Note:</strong> 1.5 and 2-yard service is provided in a split-bin and must be matched with the same size garbage service because the bin is literally split in half.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">We are happy to provide your business with assistance in developing a recycling plan as well as helping you determine if your waste is recyclable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Sample materials that can be discarded in the commingled recycling bin: office paper, plastic, metal items, cans, bottles, glass, boxes, packaging, envelopes, magazines, newspaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">You will be given a container specifically for your cardboard. We generally only offer this service to "high volume" cardboard generators and ask that if you only generate a small amount of cardboard that you mix it with other recyclables that your business has by using our commingle recycling service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Container size&nbsp;available:&nbsp;</strong>3-yard</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436553369915_396"><strong id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436553369915_395">3. Organics recycling</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">With this service you can recycle all of your organic recyclable materials (no food waste just yet). This is a great service if you have landscaping that is maintained at your business.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Container size&nbsp;available: </strong>96-gallon automated carts (we will give you several if needed)</p>

If you are interested in adding any of these services, please [contact](http://paso-waste-site.squarespace.com/contact-us) our office and we will have your additional container(s) delivered.

## Container Placement
We require that your container is placed on a cement pad with easy access. Often businesses prefer to have their container placed inside of an enclosure. A representative can be sent to your location to discuss the placement of your container as well as provide you with assistance on designing either a pad or an enclosure.
