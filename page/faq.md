## Service Questions

### HOW DO I SIGN UP FOR GARBAGE SERVICE?
Please call or stop by our office and one of our friendly customer service representatives will help you get your service started. In most cases we can deliver your trash containers to you on the same day that you start service. You could provide all information that we need to create your account over the phone.

### MY TRASH WAS NOT EMPTIED, WHAT NOW?
Please call our office, 805-238-2381. If you had your can out by 6AM on your pick-up day, we will send a truck back by your house at no charge. If your can was not out, we will send a truck to empty your can and charge you our "Go Back" fee.

### DO YOU PICK UP MY TRASH ON HOLIDAYS?
Yes! We provide service on your regularly scheduled service day 51 weeks a year. The only week that is interrupted is Christmas Week. If Christmas is on Monday and your pickup day is normally Tuesday, your pickup that week will be on Wednesday (every service that would normally be scheduled on or after Christmas will be shifted one day later in the week).

### I OCCASIONALLY HAVE MORE TRASH THAN WILL FIT IN MY CONTAINER
Please call our office. One of our customer service representatives will sell you "Extra Tags." You can use the tags anytime you have a little extra garbage. Your driver will check the extra bags that you place at the curb for a tag and if you have one, they will take the bag. Also, our trucks have cameras on them to document your extra garbage. If your container is overfull the driver will empty it after taking a picture and adding the extra charge to your account.

### I AM DOING A PROJECT AND HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA GARBAGE
We offer temporary 3 and 4 yard bin service. Call our office and they will have a container delivered to your address within a couple of business days. If you are doing a very large project and plan on having more than just a few yards of garbage you can alternatively contact Paso Robles Roll-Off, Inc. at 805-238-4897. They offer 20, 30, and 40 yard temporary containers.

## Electronic Billing Questions

### AUTOPAY – ACH
If you would like us to automatically debit your savings or checking account on the 10th (or shortly after if the 10th is not a business day) each month, this program is for you. Customers enrolled in the program still receive a paper bill but it will have a message saying "AutoPay Do Not Pay".

In order to enroll in our automated ACH payments program you need to complete an application form that gives us permission to debit your bank account. You can download the file here or you can contact our office and they will mail/fax you a copy.

### AUTOPAY – CREDIT CARD

We can process your credit card each month for your total bill amount. This program is similar to the ACH AutoPay program except we use either your VISA or MasterCard as your payment source. You will continue to receive a paper bill and it will have a message on it saying "AutoPay Do Not Pay".

These programs are great for people who do not want to worry about late payments or the hassle of mailing or hand delivering a payment.

## Traditional Billing Questions
### RESIDENTIAL

We print and mail our residential billing on the first working day of every month. Charges are due upon receipt and are delinquent after the 20th of the month. 

### COMMERCIAL

Commercial customers are billed on the last working day of the month for the services rendered during that month. Charges are due upon receipt and are delinquent after the 15th of the month.
