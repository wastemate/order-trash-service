## 2013 Recycling Information:
When in doubt, recycle it! When you place any item in our recycling can, our recycling processor, which determines the material type, will sort it. If you're not sure of the type of material but it seems reasonable that it would be recyclable, please place it in the recycling cart.

Please do not place any recycling or garbage in your green cart. Everything in the green cart needs to be compostable. Additionally, animal waste is not accepted as green waste.
