<p>View our list of recyclable materials and check back for updates. Our list increases as recycling technology improves. We offer weekly curbside pick-up of household commingled recyclables (blue cart) and organic waste (green cart) for all residential customers.</p>

<h3 id="contamination:8bb510895c15cdb2b4b1952437a3c932">CONTAMINATION</h3>

<p>Clean organic waste is a must. Our organic waste truck has a video camera to monitor organic waste container contents as it is emptied. Containers contaminated with trash will receive a service charge of $7.40 per incident. Repeat offenders will have containers removed</p>

<h3 id="motor-oil:8bb510895c15cdb2b4b1952437a3c932">MOTOR OIL</h3>

<p>It’s easy, convenient and free. Call our office at (805) 238-2381 to schedule a pick-up of your used motor oil. We will provide you with a 15-quart capacity oil container and an oil filter bag.</p>

<h3 id="batteries-and-electronic-waste-a-id-batteries-2f-e-waste:8bb510895c15cdb2b4b1952437a3c932">BATTERIES AND ELECTRONIC WASTE<a id="#batteries-%2f-e-waste"/></h3>

<p>The San Luis Obispo Integrated Waste Management Authority (IWMA) had provided us with containers to accept your household batteries and electronic waste, which are located at our office. You can drop off your materials Monday–Friday, 8am–5pm.</p>

<p>Batteries in the landfill present many health and environmental risks. By recycling these products, we will be cutting down on the amount of natural resources needed to produce the never-ending supply of batteries that our society has come to depend on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547376749_909"><strong id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547376749_908">Battery Facts (www.epa.gov)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Americans purchase nearly 3 billion dry-cell batteries every year to power radios, toys, cellular phones, watches, laptop computers, and portable power tools</li>
<li>Inside a battery, heavy metals react with chemical electrolyte to produce the battery’s power</li>
<li>Wet-cell batteries, which contain a liquid electrolyte, commonly power automobiles, boats, or motorcycles</li>
<li>Nearly 99 million wet-cell lead-acid car batteries are manufactured each year</li>
<li>Mercury was phased out of certain types of batteries in conjunction with the “Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act,” passed in 1996</li>
<li>Recycling batteries keeps heavy metals out of landfills and the air. Recycling saves resources because recovered plastic and metals can be used to make new batteries</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:40px" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547376749_602">Rechargeable batteries are a great way to cut down on the amount of batteries that end up in our waste stream. It is possible for one rechargeable battery to do the work of hundreds of single-use batteries. Once a rechargeable battery no longer holds a charge, it is best to recycle it so that it never ends up in our landfills.</p>

          City Surcharge
        </h3>
        <p>On August 1st, 2006 the Paso Robles City Council passed resolution No. 06-142, a resolution of the City of Paso Robles approving changes to solid waste collection rates for Paso Robles Waste Disposal. The first component of the resolution addresses the solid waste collection surcharge. A portion of the cost incurred by the City of Paso Robles purchasing 53 acres adjacent to the municipal landfill is to be paid by a solid waste collection surcharge on all Paso Robles Waste Disposal customers. The implementation of the surcharge will take place on September 1, 2006.
        
        Initially, residential customers will pay an additional $1.10 per month or $13.20 per year and commercial customers will pay an additional $2.34 or $28.08 annually.</p>
        <h3>Paso Robles Waste Disposal Rate Increase</h3>
        
        <p class="modal-date">January 1, 2007</p>
        <p>Paso Robles Waste Disposal will increase rates by the percent increase in the Consumer Price Index as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for “All Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers” SF-Oak-SJ region for the 12 month period ending 10/31/06.</p>
                <p class="modal-date">July 1, 2008</p>
