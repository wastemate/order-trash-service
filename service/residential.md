### BATTERIES AND ELECTRONIC WASTE<a id="batteries-%2f-e-waste"/>
The San Luis Obispo Integrated Waste Management Authority (IWMA) had provided us with containers to accept your household batteries and electronic waste, which are located at our office. You can drop off your materials Monday–Friday, 8am–5pm.

Batteries in the landfill present many health and environmental risks. By recycling these products, we will be cutting down on the amount of natural resources needed to produce the never-ending supply of batteries that our society has come to depend on.

<p style="margin-left:40px" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547376749_909"><strong id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547376749_908">Battery Facts (www.epa.gov)</strong></p>

1. Americans purchase nearly 3 billion dry-cell batteries every year to power radios, toys, cellular phones, watches, laptop computers, and portable power tools
2. Inside a battery, heavy metals react with chemical electrolyte to produce the battery’s power
3. Wet-cell batteries, which contain a liquid electrolyte, commonly power automobiles, boats, or motorcycles
4. Nearly 99 million wet-cell lead-acid car batteries are manufactured each year
5. Mercury was phased out of certain types of batteries in conjunction with the “Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act,” passed in 1996
6. Recycling batteries keeps heavy metals out of landfills and the air. Recycling saves resources because recovered plastic and metals can be used to make new batteries

<p style="margin-left:40px" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547376749_909"><strong id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547376749_908">Battery Facts (www.epa.gov)</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547376749_602">Rechargeable batteries are a great way to cut down on the amount of batteries that end up in our waste stream. It is possible for one rechargeable battery to do the work of hundreds of single-use batteries. Once a rechargeable battery no longer holds a charge, it is best to recycle it so that it never ends up in our landfills.</p>

### FLUORESCENT LAMP AND TUBE RECYCLING
The San Luis Obispo IWMA has provided us with containers to accept your household fluorescent lamps and tubes at our office. You can drop off your materials Monday–Friday, 8am–5pm.
